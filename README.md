# Traffic Fatalities Analysis

This is my project for the course 36-315: Statistical Graphics and Visualization. My group investigated the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) dataset published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Our analysis highlighted trends in traffic fatalities across geographic location, time of day, and time of year. We also looked into qualitative variables such as lighting conditions on the road and how often fatal accidents involved drunk drivers. Only data from 2016 was used for this analysis.
